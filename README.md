# Python_OSI_Flashcards
Small python script designed to aid in basic revision of the OSI model

This was created to aid in the revision of the OSI model. The program asks the user how many times they wish to "play".

Then the program asks the user a question. The question will either provide a layer number or layer description and the user must give the correct answer.
